Let's create **_earthquake early-warning (EEW) systems_** for every seismically-vulnerable community in the world!

OpenEEW is an initiative by [Grillo](https://grillo.io), IBM and The Linux Foundation to create low cost, open source, IoT-based earthquake early warning systems (EEWs).

This includes

- Entire archive of **unprocessed accelerometer data** from Mexico, Chile, and other countries, including earthquakes records with magnitudes above 7 and recorded at different distances
- **Algorithms for the detection and characterization of earthquakes** in real time
- **Software examples** for creating your own EEW server
- **Hardware designs and firmware** so you can build your own IoT-based seismic sensors
- **Application software** so that users can receive your alerts via mobile apps, devices and more
- **Guidance to help with your project** including deployment of sensors, installations, and more

## What is an Earthquake Early-Warning (EEW)?

An earthquake early-warning (EEW) system is a set of technologies that detect and characterize a significant earthquake, rapidly sending the information to nearby communities, before the shaking arrives, so that they can prepare and act appropriately.

[Only some governments have attempted to build EEWs](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/special-themes/disaster-risk-reduction/geohazard-risk-reduction/early-warning-systems/ip-eews/) due to the incredibly high-cost of traditional seismometers, dedicated telecommunications, and bespoke software.

[Grillo](https://grillo.io) has already demonstrated that an IoT-based approach to EEW systems is not only within the reach of many global citizens, but [performs as well if not better than some government-run systems](https://openeew.com/blog/eew-benchmark).

**_OpenEEW_** is a [Call for CodeÂ® with The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/code-and-response/) project that features a set of core Grillo EEW components; hardware, software and know-how, that will place effective EEWs to be within the reach of many underserved communities around the world.

All OpenEEW projects require the following components:

- **A network of OpenEEW sensors**. You can [build your own](https://github.com/openeew/openeew-sensor/tree/master/pcb), or [buy here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/gifts_detail/OpenEEW_Node.html).

- **A detection system running on a server**. We host a [global dashboard](https://dashboard.openeew.com) that monitors everyone's devices and reports events.

- **A method for sending alerts**. For example, to a Twitter account, a mobile app, or an IoT device.
