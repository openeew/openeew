OpenEEW is an open network of affordable seismic stations distributed around the world that send data to a detection system for earthquake early-warnings (EEWs).

Traditional government-run EEWs have cost 10s millions of USD, but instead OpenEEW relies on modern and affordable off-the-shelf IoT and Cloud technologies. Since 2017 [Grillo has demonstrated](https://grillo.io/comparison-of-mexicos-earthquake-early-warning-systems/) that a cheaper IoT-based EEW can perform as well as an expensive traditional solution.

## Learn More
Please refer to the Wiki for more information about Earthquake Early-Warnings, the function, various implementations, and the uniqueness of OpenEEW's open source solution.

## Get Started
To participate you need an OpenEEW seismic sensor. You can make your own PCB following these instructions, or you can buy one at directly from PCBWay.

Once you have a sensor, please refer to the Wiki for instructions on installation, provisioning, and monitoring.

## Dashboard
To view sensors and earthquake events you can visit the OpenEEW dashboard. If you have your own sensor you can sign in here and see additional information relating to your device.

## Contribute
You can contribute to OpenEEW by

- Providing Pull Requests (Features, Proof of Concepts, Language files or Fixes)
- Testing new released features and reporting issues
- Contributing missing documentation for features

## History
OpenEEW was initiated by [Grillo](https://grillo.io) in 2019 as a means to share its growing [sensor data](https://registry.opendata.aws/grillo-openeew/) via the AWS Open Data program. In 2020, IBM and Linux Foundation joined to support the open source project and help expand it to include hardware schematics and firmware, as well as code for the detection system, dashboard and alerts.
