## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC will be responsible for all technical oversight of the OpenEEW project. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone.

The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

### Responsibilities

The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

- Coordinating the technical direction of the Project.
- Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope).
- Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects.
- Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements.
- Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities.
- Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies.
- Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing.

The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the CONTRIBUTING file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in this CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

### TSC Voting

While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.
